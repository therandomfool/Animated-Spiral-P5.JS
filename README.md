# Animated Spiral P5.JS

- colorMode() changes the way p5.js interprets color data. Setting colorMode(HSB) lets you use the HSB system instead. By default, this is colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100, 1).

- createVector() Creates a new p5.Vector (the datatype for storing vectors). This provides a two or three dimensional vector, specifically a Euclidean (also known as geometric) vector. A vector is an entity that has both magnitude and direction.
